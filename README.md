## Location Data API

This is a RESTful API built with Node.js and Express, which provides location data, specifically for regions, states and local governments.

This API uses a database of location data and a caching mechanism for better performance. You will need to provide an API key for authorization. The API endpoints can be found below.

## API Endpoints

The API provides the following endpoints:

1. **Get Regions**: `/region`

   Fetches the data of a specific region or all regions if no region name is provided. You can also specify whether you want to include Local Government Areas (LGAs) by setting the `lga` query parameter to `true`.

2. **Get States**: `/state`

   Fetches the data of a specific state or all states if no state name is provided. You can also specify whether you want to include Local Government Areas (LGAs) by setting the `lga` query parameter to `true`.

3. **Get Local Government**: `/lga`

   Fetches the data of a specific or all local government.

### API Usage

To test on your local with swagger, use
```
localhost:3000/api-docs
```

The API uses bearer token for authorization, so you have to include your API key in the Authorization header as follows:

```
Authorization: your_api_key
```

Here is an example of how to use the API:

**Request:**

```
GET /state?state_name=lagos&lga=true
Authorization: your_api_key
```

**Response:**
